    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted programming language, meaning that every line of any given file is read and immediately executed, as opposed to being compiled to an intermediate format before execution. It features numerous components of other modern programming languages including dynamic typing, high-level data types, object-orientation, and classes. Its simple syntax and numerous third party libraries are what make the language powerful and versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimizations and features found in python has made it a popular choice for programmers and companies, including Dropbox, Instagram, Spotify, and Reddit, who want to embrace object-oriented programming without the complicated \"boilerplate\" which comes with other popular object-oriented programming languages. A good portion of the optimizations which python offers comes from it's \"built-ins\", or built-in utility functions. Python's built-ins are written in C, which means you can expect C-like performance when you run your code (unless your code is slow).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have python, you can download it for your system [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python files are created and saved with the `.py` extension. Once installed, you should be able to configure python to work with your IDE of choice, if any configuration is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial and solution files are available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/BernardScottIII/acm_python_event). \n",
    "\n",
    "^^ This should be displayed with GitHub Pages or other free static-website software!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "To start things off, python has several primitive types built-in to the language upon install, including `int`, `float`, `bool` (boolean), and `str`. The two numeric types support \"mixed arithmetic\", meaning python will perform the mathematical operation you desire, and give you a result. Type conversion will be discussed in a later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is lenient with what you can name variables. The only officially enforced convention is that names with only capital letters are immutable constants. However, the python community has introduced best practices and guidelines for styling python code, which is known as the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) series. The current version, PEP 8, stipulates that variables should be all lowercase with words separated by underscores, as shown below."

    "#### Elementary I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way for programmers to debug their programs is to use print statements, and a lot of them! Like many other features of the language, python's `print()` statements are easy to use and contain great functionality. By default, all `print()` statements will write the value of their first argument to the terminal. Programmers can use `print()` statements with any object that has a `__repr__()` function, a.k.a. python's toString(). A common use of `print()` statements involves the use of formatted string literals, or f-strings for short. F-strings allow the programmer to write expressions within a string using `{}`. Writing strings this way improves the readability of one's code and is convienent for the programmer."

    "\n",
    "#### Flow Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any programming language, python features several types of flow control, most notably `for` and `while` loops. `for` loops in python are unique in the sense that their syntax is more conducive to iterating through an entire list, as opposed to executing a specified number of times. \n",

    "An integral part of programming in python is understanding indentation. Python uses indentation to distinguish which lines of code belong to which containers (\"blocks\" of code belong to different loops, functions, classes, etc.). Python only requires that the programmer be _consistent_ with their indentation throughout the program, using any amount of space per indentation they desire. However, it is best practice to use 4 spaces to indent your code to signify that it is part of a function or loop."

    "### Compilation vs. Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to many other programming languages Python is interpreted not compiled. This means that all python code is translated into machine code at run time as opposed to needing to go through a pre compilation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "Compilation means that code is translated from the native programming language to machine code either to be ran on the actual CPU or in java's case on a JVM. The benefit of using languages which are compiled is that they often lead to greater performance since the code can be compiled at run time and in multiple steps. Code needs to be compiled for a particular CPU architecture in order for it to be compatible and there is often a few different options for compilers. Another benefit of compilers is that they allow for code obsucation. This means that the source code does not need to be distributed to the end user which can make it more difficult for the end user to modify its function and reverse engineer how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation means that code is essentially interpreted at runtime as opposed to being compiled at compiled time. Languages which use this technique are often slower as they must wait on this interpretation step to be completed before they are able to be executed. However, when a programming language is interpreted it allows greater flexability like in pythons case allowing functions to be declared dynamically at runtime. To the average user an interpreted language like python might behave very similar to lower level compiled programming languages like C and Java but under the hood it behaves differently.\n",
