    "Python is an interpreted programming language, meaning that every line of any given file is read and immediately executed, as opposed to being compiled to an intermediate format before execution. It features numerous components of other modern programming languages including dynamic typing, high-level data types, object-orientation, and classes. Its simple syntax and numerous third party libraries are what make the language powerful and versatile.\n",

Assignment of instance variables takes place completely within the `__init__()` function. Python does not allow for the declaration of multiple constructors, (insert reasoning). However, you can supply default arguments to the lone constructor, which may or may not be used upon invoking the constructor.\n"
